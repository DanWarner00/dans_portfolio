## Bike Store Dashboard

Welcome to my Bike Store Project. This project involved creating tables to Microsoft SQL, cleaning, merging, and grouping the data. Connecting SQL to Excel to create pivot tables and an Excel dashboard.
Then finally connecting it to Tableau Public to create another more interactive dashboard. The dataset includes information about Bike store locations, Bike types, Customer names, Sales rep names, order dates, revenue and more.

The goal was to create an easily digestable dashboard that stakeholders could get quick infomation about profitable stores, customers, years, bike models and more at a glance. This is aimed to assist business operations and potentially improving sales strategies.
